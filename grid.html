                  <p class="text-sm-left">The Bakery started in 1986 as a little bakery cafe and pizzeria on Willamette Street in Eugene, Oregon. Popularity and local demand for their products grew, and a larger production facility was needed. Wholesale operations began in the early 1990s and the bakery began supplying Eugene markets with locally made organic breads. Today our Bakery offers a wide variety of breads, pizza dough, granola, cookies and hummus-style garbanzo spreads. Our products can be found in over 60 natural food grocers and markets, in Eugene, Springfield, Corvallis, Salem, Portland, Bend, Southern Oregon and the Oregon Coast. Our breads are also found in over 50 restaurants in Eugene, Springfield and Corvallis. We seek out high quality ingredients for our loaves, and never use any artificial additives or preservatives. We are proud to partner with local wheat farmers and Camas Country Mill to offer products made from whole wheat that is grown locally in Oregon and milled right here in the Eugene area. Whether it's lunch or a special treat, you and your family will love our selection of baked goods including seeded bread, wraps, cakes, muffins and pastries. We also have a great choice of fresh bread, and a range of gluten free bread, cakes and biscuits. Our accomplished team of  professionals is here to help you create beautiful and memorable desserts for your special day.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm-left">The Bakery started in 1986 as a little bakery cafe and pizzeria on Willamette Street in Eugene, Oregon. Popularity and local demand for their products grew, and a larger production facility was needed. Wholesale operations began in the early 1990s and the bakery began supplying Eugene markets with locally made organic breads. Today our Bakery offers a wide variety of breads, pizza dough, granola, cookies and hummus-style garbanzo spreads. Our products can be found in over 60 natural food grocers and markets, in Eugene, Springfield, Corvallis, Salem, Portland, Bend, Southern Oregon and the Oregon Coast. Our breads are also found in over 50 restaurants in Eugene, Springfield and Corvallis. We seek out high quality ingredients for our loaves, and never use any artificial additives or preservatives.</p>
